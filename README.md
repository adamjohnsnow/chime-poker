This is a work-in-progress personal project that I will use to try out new technologies, approaches or just to practice.

This is intended to be a multi-player poker game with video calling. Tech used:

- AWS Chime for video calls
- NextJS for framework, using React/Typescript
- Firebase Realtime Database for data persistence and websockets
- Vercel for hosting and deployment
- Jest for TDD testing

Can be previewed at [Poker Face Game](https://poker-face-game.vercel.app/)

Maybe one day this will be a fully featured poker game with video chat...
