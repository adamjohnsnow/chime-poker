This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I am not sure of the purpose of it yet - I am going to just add new things as I want to work on them, testing with Jest, refactoring classes, websockets, some tailwind CSS. Seeing where this might take me.

Maybe one day this will be a fully featured poker game with video chat...
